description: |-
  The "Bring your own data QnA" is a pre-trained Q&A model, enhanced by GPT3.5, that leverages your personally indexed data to deliver more concrete and relevant answers. It involves processing the raw query through an embedding procedure, followed by a "Vector Search" to pinpoint the most pertinent context within the user's data. Subsequently, GPT3.5 is employed to generate a comprehensive answer to the question using the sourced documents.

  ### Sample inputs and outputs (for real-time inference)

  #### Sample input
  ```json
  {
      "inputs": {
          "question": "How to use SDK V2?"
      }
  }
  ```

  #### Sample output
  ```json
  {
      "outputs": {
          "output": "To use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2, you need to have an Azure Machine Learning workspace and the SDK installed. You can either create a compute instance, which automatically installs the SDK and is pre-configured for ML workflows, or use the provided commands to install the SDK.
