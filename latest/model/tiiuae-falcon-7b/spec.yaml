  Falcon-7B is a large language model with 7 billion parameters. It is a causal decoder-only model developed by TII and trained on 1,500 billion tokens of RefinedWeb dataset, which was enhanced with curated corpora. The model is available under the Apache 2.0 license. It outperforms comparable open-source models and features an architecture optimized for inference. However, it is a raw, pretrained model that should be further finetuned for most use cases.

  The model is recommended for research on large language models and as a foundation for further specialization and finetuning for specific tasks. It should not be used in production without adequate assessment of risks and mitigation. The model carries biases commonly encountered online and is trained on English and French data only.

  The training details of Falcon-7B include information about the training data, training procedure, and hyperparameters used. It was trained on 384 A100 40GB GPUs using a 2D parallelism strategy combined with ZeRO. The model description mentions the architectural adaptations from the GPT-3 model, such as rotary positional embeddings, multiquery attention, and FlashAttention.

  ### Training Details

  #### Training Data

  Falcon-7B was trained on 1,500B tokens of [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb), a high-quality filtered and deduplicated web dataset which we enhanced with curated corpora. Significant components from our curated copora were inspired by The Pile ([Gao et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027)).

  The data was tokenized with the Falcon-[7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)/[40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) tokenizer.

  #### Training Procedure 

  Falcon-7B was trained on 384 A100 40GB GPUs, using a 2D parallelism strategy (PP=2, DP=192) combined with ZeRO.

  #### Technical Specifications 

  #### Model Architecture and Objective

  Falcon-7B is a causal decoder-only model trained on a causal language modeling task (i.e., predict the next token).

  The architecture is broadly adapted from the GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)), with the following differences:

  * **Positionnal embeddings:** rotary ([Su et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864));
  * **Attention:** multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)) and FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135));
  * **Decoder-block:** parallel attention/MLP with a single layer norm.
